### I had technical difficulties. For some reason when I completed the assignment the first time, when I pushed it to github; the conditionals directory and variables_practice directory were included in this directory. I made sure I initialized in the correct place. Another directory named variables_practice had the conditionals directory added to it as well. I managed to fix it by creating a new local directory and did all the work there.
